        "content": "\tWe are evolutionarily programmed to seek others' approval and are equally prone to jealousy. People showcase idealized versions of their lives for admiration, which only exacerbates the culture of comparison and FOMO. Basing your worth and happiness on others' approval invariably leads to a desire for more and better. How can one be content when nothing seems good enough?\n\n\tThe hedonic treadmill theory suggests that regardless of our circumstances, from losing a job to winning the lottery, we tend to return to a baseline level of happiness. This doesn’t mean you should quit your job with the expectation of being just as happy living on the streets. Goals and aspirations are important because they provide direction among other things; however, it's misguided to believe that reaching the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow will finally make you happy. What's preventing you from feeling that way now?\n\n\tThe disparity between expressions on a sunny day and a cloudy one is remarkable. It's as if you could predict the weather given a collection of headshots. However, stormy days are inevitable; are our emotions forever bound to circumstance? The first practice I advocate for is consistently seeking the silver lining in every storm cloud. This habit encourages us to recognize growth opportunities in all situations. By identifying the positives in challenging times, we condition our minds to value the present and discover joy in our journey. Understand that there are things we can control and things we can't. Worrying about things beyond our reach is a waste of time and simply makes us feel bad for no reason.\n\n\tImagine life as an art gallery filled with paintings that depict your daily experiences.  As the manager of this fine establishment, you may have limited control over which paintings you acquire, but the way you frame them is entirely up to you. While some frames can detract from a painting's beauty, others can enhance it significantly. Here are a few framing perspectives you might consider:\n\n* Adventure Frame: See life as an exciting journey, embracing challenges and joys as part of a grand adventure.\n* Comedic Frame: “Laughter, and a lot of it, is the right response to the things which drive us to tears” - Seneca\n* Gratitude Frame: There are things to be thankful for in every situation.\n* Growth Frame: Challenging experiences are great opportunities for growth.\n* Incompetence vs. Malice: \"When you wake up in the morning, tell yourself: the people I deal with today will be meddling, ungrateful, arrogant, dishonest, jealous and surly. They are like this because they can't tell good from evil. But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil, and have recognized that the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own - not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind, and possessing a share of the divine. And so none of them can hurt me.\" - Marcus Aurelius\n* Possibility Frame: Open-minded to the possibilities the situation might bring.\n*Prospective Restrospection: Think nostalgically about the present because these are the good ol' days despite their shortcomings.\n* Storytelling Frame: “This is gonna make my autobiography go crazy, bro.” - Sr. Frijoles"

        "title": "Understanding Sleep",
        "content": "\tGood sleep is essential for physical/mental health, cognitive performance, immune function, and overall quality of life. Since it’s deeply interconnected with wakefulness, this article aims to equip you with actionable tools to achieve the best sleep possible.\n\n\tTwo main forces govern sleep: adenosine and circadian rhythms. Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in our nervous system while we are awake, creating a sleep drive. The longer we are awake, the higher the adenosine levels. Caffeine temporarily blocks adenosine receptors, making us feel more awake. Circadian rhythms are natural, internal processes that regulate the sleep-wake cycle and repeat roughly every 24 hours. These rhythms regulate the release of hormones that control sleep and wakefulness.\n\n\tCortisol, often referred to as the 'stress hormone,' has a vital role in your wake-up process. Released from your adrenal glands, a morning surge of cortisol signals your body it's time to wake up. This hormone increases your heart rate, muscle tension, and alertness, preparing you for the day's activities. The timing of this cortisol release is crucial; it should occur early in the day and in a single burst, setting the tone for your wakefulness. This cortisol pulse can be triggered naturally or by an alarm clock.\n\n\tMelatonin, known as the sleep hormone, is naturally produced by the pineal gland. Its release is timed by a biological clock set each morning by the rise in cortisol, typically resulting in melatonin secretion 12-14 hours later to induce sleepiness.\n\n\tSleep consists of two main types: Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep and Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. These stages form a sleep cycle that lasts about 90 minutes, repeating several times each night. The first half of the night is dominated by deep NREM sleep, crucial for physical recovery, tissue repair, and immune function. The second half features longer REM stages, which support brain functions like learning, memory consolidation, and emotional processing."

        "title": "Practical Tips - Light",
        "content": "[[bold]]1) Aim for 5-10 minutes of direct sunlight exposure as soon as possible after waking up.[[/bold]]\n\n*The neurons in our eyes responsible for setting the circadian clock respond best to a specific quality and intensity of light found in morning sunlight, especially when the sun is at a low solar angle. This early light contains a unique contrast between yellows and blues, essential for activating these neurons and consequently synchronizing all the cellular clocks in your body. Note that viewing sunlight through windows or windshields is 50 times less effective than direct exposure.\n\n*To effectively set your circadian rhythm, aim for light exposure that sums up to at least 100,000 lux. The concept here is cumulative: it's about the total amount of light your eyes receive over a period, not just the intensity at a single moment. For context, typical indoor lighting, like a computer or phone screen, provides around 500 to 1,000 lux. If you're exposed to light of 1,000 lux intensity, you would need approximately 100 minutes to reach 100,000 lux. However, natural outdoor light can be much more intense than indoor lighting. Even on a cloudy day, outdoor light can provide tens of thousands of lux, enabling you to reach the 100,000 lux target in a significantly shorter period.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]2) Make it a habit to witness the sunset or get some late afternoon sunlight.[[/bold]]\n\n*The wavelengths of afternoon light, particularly the yellows and oranges seen at sunset, are essential for signaling to your brain that the day is transitioning into evening. While this doesn't directly initiate melatonin release, it reinforces the end-of-day timing in your circadian rhythm. This is crucial in mitigating the impact of artificial light exposure at night. By consistently exposing yourself to these natural light cues in both the morning and during sunset, you're effectively anchoring your internal clock.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]3) Reduce night time light exposure.[[/bold]]\n\n*As the day goes on, your retina grows more sensitive to light. This means that even a small amount of light from screens or lights in the evening can disturb your sleep pattern and may also suppress the release of dopamine, a key neurotransmitter associated with mood and learning. While occasional exposure to bright light at night isn't typically harmful, regular exposure to intense light late in the evening can have negative effects on your health. For this reason, it's advisable to use the night light setting on your devices and reduce screen brightness in the evening. Ideally, you should make these adjustments about an hour or two before you plan to go to bed.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]4) Switch to dim lights with red or yellow tints in the evening.[[/bold]]\n\n*These lights have longer wavelengths, which are less likely to suppress melatonin than other types of lighting. Interestingly, natural sources of light like candlelight don't trigger the activation of the cells in your eyes, making them also suitable for evening use, just don't burn the house down.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]5) Placing lights lower in your room, such as on a desktop or the floor, can help reduce the impact of evening light.[[/bold]]\n\n*The cells in your eyes that help set your internal clock are mainly in the bottom half of your retina. Because of how your eye is shaped, these cells mostly look at the upper part of what you see, presumably because we’ve evolved to use the overhead sun as our reference."

        "title": "Practical Tips - Temperature",
        "content": "[[bold]]1) Use cold exposure strategically.[[/bold]]\n\n*Engaging in cold exposure early in the day can indeed lead to a rebound increase in thermogenesis. This is the body's way of generating heat to counteract the cold. As your internal body temperature rises post-exposure, it can signal your body to be more alert and advance your circadian clock, making you more likely to wake up earlier the next day. Cold exposure in the evening interferes with your body's natural temperature decline, leading to delayed signaling for sleep readiness. This confusion of the circadian clock can make you feel more alert, potentially causing a later sleep onset and shifting your sleep-wake cycle.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]2) Use hot exposure strategically.[[/bold]]\n\n* Heating your body in the evening can help you fall asleep earlier. This is because the body associates warmth with relaxation and the winding down process that precedes sleep. The gradual cooling that follows can mimic the natural decline in body temperature, facilitating sleep onset. Conversely, heating your body in the morning can delay your wake-up time. This is because an increase in body temperature is associated with relaxation and readiness for sleep, counteracting the body's natural process of becoming more alert and active in the morning.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]3) Identify and consider your body’s temperature minimum, typically occurring 90 minutes to two hours before your regular waking time.[[/bold]]\n\n*Knowing your temperature minimum can help you adjust your circadian rhythm. Engaging in activities like eating, viewing sunlight, or exercising four to six hours before your temperature minimum can delay your clock, making you inclined to sleep and wake up later. Conversely, doing these activities four to six hours after your temperature minimum can advance your clock, encouraging earlier sleep and wake times.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]4) Keep your bedroom temperature between 60-67°F (15-19°C).[[/bold]]\n\n*A cooler environment aligns with your body’s natural temperature drop at night, facilitating quicker sleep onset and promoting deeper sleep phases like REM. This thermal alignment not only improves sleep quality but also supports cognitive restoration and mood regulation, essential for daytime functioning."

        "title": "Practical Tips - Diet",
        "content": "[[bold]]1) Eat earlier in the day to promote an earlier sleep-wake cycle.[[/bold]]\n\n*Eating early in the day helps to align your internal clock with natural daylight, promoting wakefulness by allowing your body to start its metabolic activities earlier.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]2) Try to avoid eating at least 90 minutes before you plan on sleeping. But, if hunger strikes before bed, choosing the right snack can impact your sleep quality.[[/bold]]\n\n*Ideal choices include almonds and walnuts, rich in magnesium and tryptophan, which aid sleep regulation. Cherries and bananas are good for their natural melatonin, promoting sleep onset. A glass of milk, yogurt, or a small serving of turkey, all high in tryptophan, can also be soothing. Eating carbohydrates later in the evening, which contains the precursor ingredients for melatonin, may also help improve sleep. Avoid heavy meals close to bedtime, focusing instead on these nutrient-rich, sleep-friendly options. Conversely, certain foods can disrupt sleep: Citrus Fruits: Can cause indigestion, affecting sleep. Spicy Foods: May lead to heartburn and discomfort. Chocolate: Contains caffeine, potentially keeping you awake. Fried Foods: Hard to digest, leading to discomfort. Alcohol: Impairs sleep quality, despite initial drowsiness.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]3) Use supplements wisely and consult with a healthcare provider.[[/bold]]\n\n*While [u]melatonin[/u] supplements are popular, they pose potential risks. For one, melatonin can affect puberty hormones, especially in young people. In adults, its impact on other hormonal systems remains a concern. Additionally, melatonin may aid in falling asleep but not necessarily in staying asleep, with many users experiencing wakefulness in the middle of the night. The content of over-the-counter melatonin is also highly variable and unregulated, which can lead to inconsistency in dosage and effectiveness. Given these factors, careful consideration and possibly seeking safer alternatives for sleep support are advised.\n\n*[u]Magnesium[/u], especially in the form of magnesium threonate or bisglycinate, is known for its beneficial effects on sleep. These particular types of magnesium assist in increasing the neurotransmitter GABA, which plays a crucial role in calming the mind and reducing 'duration-path-outcome' (DPO) type thinking, which involves overanalyzing past events or worrying about future outcomes, a common hindrance to falling asleep. Magnesium can stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is in charge of lowering blood pressure, relaxing muscles, and having a calming impact all around. Taking magnesium threonate 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime can aid in falling and staying asleep.\n\n*[u]Theanine[/u], an amino acid commonly found in tea, has a notable soothing effect on mood. It increases alpha brain waves, which are associated with a state of calm and relaxation, in contrast to Beta and Gamma brain waves linked to alertness and problem-solving. However, it's important to note that theanine can intensify dream vividness, which might not be suitable for individuals prone to sleepwalking or night terrors. Additionally, around 10% of people may find theanine stimulating rather than calming. If you fall into this category, it's advisable to avoid theanine as a relaxation aid. Always consider your personal reactions to supplements like theanine to ensure they align with your health needs and sleep patterns.\n\n*[u]Apigenin[/u], a compound found in chamomile, is another supplement known for promoting sleepiness and aiding in both falling and staying asleep. A dose of apigenin taken 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime can be beneficial for enhancing sleep quality. However, it's important to be aware that apigenin is a potent estrogen inhibitor. This means that women, particularly those wanting to maintain their current estrogen levels, should consider avoiding apigenin. Men should also be cautious, as estrogen is essential for various bodily functions, and its significant reduction can adversely affect libido and cognitive abilities. Given its strong estrogen-inhibiting properties, it's crucial to weigh the benefits and potential hormonal impacts of apigenin before incorporating it into your routine.\n\n*[u]Myo-Inositol[/u], a type of sugar found in the brain and other tissues, plays a crucial role in cell signal conversion, responding to various external signals like hormones and neurotransmitters. These signals, upon reaching a cell, are converted into internal messengers, a process in which myo-inositol is actively involved. Regular intake of Myo-Inositol, as part of a sleep stack, has been observed to improve sleep quality, particularly in reducing wakefulness at night and aiding in falling asleep more quickly again. It's important to note that there are different forms of inositol supplements, including Myo-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, and Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6). If a product is labeled simply as “Inositol,” it usually refers to Myo-Inositol, but it's advisable to confirm this for accurate supplementation.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]4) Aim for consistent meal times[[/bold]]\n\nConsistent meal times are good for sleep because they are another cue allowing your circadian rhythm to stabalize. This also improves digestion which can prevent discomfort during sleep and reduces the urge for late-night eating."

        "title": "Practical Tips - Exercise",
        "content": "[[bold]]1) Key windows identified in exercise and circadian science literature[[/bold]]\n\n*30 minutes after waking, aligning with a surge in cortisol; three hours after waking, coinciding with a rise in body temperature; and 11 hours after waking, when body temperature typically peaks. Exercise timing can impact performance and injury risk, correlating with your body's temperature cycles. While these timeframes offer opportunities to maximize exercise benefits, it's crucial to determine what best aligns with your lifestyle and physical responses. These are not strict recommendations but rather suggestions based on scientific insights to explore and adapt according to personal needs and daily routines.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]2) Engage in exercise first thing in the morning to advance your circadian rhythm.[[/bold]]\n\n*This sets up an anticipatory circuit in your body, leveraging the plasticity of your circadian rhythms. This adaptation can lead to a natural inclination to wake up around the same time you exercised on previous days, effectively 'phase advancing' your internal clock. However, it's also crucial to pair this morning exercise with light exposure. The combination of light and physical activity sends a stronger wake-up signal to your brain and body, amplifying the effect. Consider this synergy when planning your morning routine, as it can be a potent tool for aligning your sleep-wake cycle with your desired schedule.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]3) Pay attention to how your exercise routine impacts your sleep quality.[[/bold]]\n\n*If you find yourself struggling with sleep quality, particularly after intense evening workouts, it could be a sign that your exercise intensity is too high. Conversely, constant fatigue, regardless of ample sleep, may suggest your overall training volume is excessive. Using sleep as a barometer for your workout regimen allows you to identify and adjust your exercise intensity and volume for optimal recovery. This approach ensures your training enhances your well-being rather than impeding it, maintaining a healthy balance between physical activity and restful sleep."

        "title": "Practical Tips - Lifestyle",
        "content": "[[bold]]1) Try to maintain a consistent daily routine for waking, sleeping, and exercising to harness neuroplasticity for improved sleep and wakefulness.[[/bold]]\n\n*Adhering to a regular routine plays a crucial role in optimizing your sleep health. When you consistently wake up and expose yourself to sunlight, exercise at a certain time, or follow a particular eating schedule, your body begins to anticipate these activities. This anticipation is driven by neuroplasticity, where neural circuits adapt to your habits, tuning themselves to align with your daily patterns. As a result, hormones and other signals are secreted in anticipation, preparing your body for waking up, exercising, or winding down for sleep. Establishing a rhythm, even if it's not strictly timed to the minute, makes it easier over time to wake up early or exercise consistently, thanks to the adaptability of these neural circuits. Embracing this aspect of neuroplasticity can significantly enhance your overall well-being and sleep quality.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]2) Prioritize sleep consistency over duration; regularity in your sleep schedule is key to better learning and cognitive performance.[[/bold]]\n\n*The effectiveness of sleep on cognitive performance and learning is more closely linked to the consistency of your sleep schedule rather than the total hours slept. Maintaining a regular pattern, such as consistently sleeping six hours each night, can be more beneficial than a fluctuating schedule where the duration varies significantly each night. This stability in sleeping patterns plays a crucial role in memory consolidation and managing cognitive tasks. Even if the total sleep duration is less than the recommended amount, a consistent schedule can lead to improved performance and mental clarity. Hence, striving for a regular amount of sleep each night should be a key focus for enhancing your overall cognitive health and learning efficiency.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]3) Determine your ideal bedtime by tracking your afternoon energy dip.[[/bold]]\n\n*Your body's natural rhythm includes an afternoon energy dip, a period when you may feel a noticeable decrease in alertness and energy often occurring between two to four in the afternoon. This dip, experienced by everyone to varying degrees, is often linked to a change in body temperature. To find your optimal bedtime, observe when this afternoon slump occurs and calculate seven hours from that point. This time frame is generally the ideal period for going to bed, aligning with your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]4) Napping for a short duration, typically 20 to 30 minutes, is an excellent way to counteract this afternoon energy dip.[[/bold]]\n\n*Keeping your nap under one ultradian cycle (around 90 minutes) ensures you wake up before entering deeper sleep stages, which can leave you feeling groggy. Some people might feel disoriented after napping due to insufficient nighttime sleep, while others find naps incredibly rejuvenating. The response to napping varies from person to person. Experimenting with the timing and duration of your naps can help you discover the most effective way to enhance your daily productivity and overall well-being.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]5) Create a pre-sleep routine to signal bedtime, aiding consistency even with a varying schedule.[[/bold]]\n\n*Develop a relaxing pre-sleep routine to signal your body it's time to wind down, helpful for irregular schedules. This could include activities like reading, light stretching, journaling, or a warm shower. Engaging in this routine assists in transitioning to sleep mode, making it easier to fall asleep. This practice can be particularly useful when your schedule varies, helping to maintain sleep quality despite changes in bedtime[hr]\n\n[[bold]]6) Turn to the body as a means to influence sleep drive.[[/bold]]\n\n*Yoga nidra, also known as 'yoga sleep,' is a guided meditation lasting from 10 to 60 minutes, designed to deeply relax your body and mind. While it can sometimes lead to sleep, its primary goal is to bring you into a restful yet aware state. Standard meditation practices also play a key role in calming the mind, especially useful for those who struggle to unwind before bedtime. These techniques effectively reduce stress-related nervous system activity, enhancing your ability to fall asleep or subsequently improve wakefulness after the practice. They serve as self-training tools, teaching your nervous system to shift from unwanted alertness to desired relaxation. Whether it's after morning sunlight exposure, during nocturnal awakenings, or any other time, these relaxation techniques are always beneficial, acting as a training mechanism for achieving heightened relaxation on demand. The challenge of falling asleep often lies in the difficulty of controlling the mind with the mind. In such instances, it's more effective to turn to the body as a means to clear mental states."

        "title": "Practical Tips - Jetlag & Shift Work",
        "content": "[[bold]]1) To mitigate jet lag when traveling eastward.[[/bold]]\n\n*Start adjusting your routine a few days before departure by waking up earlier and getting bright light exposure, possibly combined with exercise and an early meal. Traveling eastward, such as from California to Europe, presents a challenge for your circadian rhythm due to the need to advance your internal clock. Start by waking up around your temperature minimum (~90 mins before waking up), or slightly later, a few days before your trip. Incorporate bright light exposure, exercise, and an early meal to advance your circadian clock. Upon arrival, try to eat according to the local schedule. If you're not hungry for breakfast at the new location, it indicates that your liver's biological clock hasn't yet adapted. While you can choose to eat or skip the meal, it's crucial to avoid adhering to your home meal schedule, especially eating in the middle of the night. This misalignment can disrupt your circadian rhythm, as the peripheral clocks in organs like the liver send conflicting signals to the brain. For trips shorter than 48 hours, it may be more practical to stay on your home schedule. These strategies help align both your central and peripheral biological clocks with the new time zone, minimizing the effects of jet lag.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]2) To counteract jet lag when traveling westward.[[/bold]]\n\n*Use caffeine, exercise, and sunlight to stay awake until the local evening. Traveling westward, such as from Europe to California, means you need to delay your circadian rhythm, an easier task than advancing it. If you arrive in the afternoon and feel overwhelmingly tired, resist the urge to nap. Instead, strategically use caffeine, exercise, and exposure to sunlight or artificial light if needed. These stimulants can help delay your internal clock, allowing you to stay awake until the local evening hours. Similar to traveling eastward, try to eat on the local schedule and avoid it altogether if the trip is less than 48 hours.[hr]\n\n[[bold]]3) For shift workers, try to maintain the same work and sleep schedule for at least 14 days, including weekends.[[/bold]]\n\n*Shift work, particularly the swing shift pattern, poses significant challenges to health, disrupting natural cortisol rhythms, learning processes, and overall well-being. The most effective strategy for shift workers is to maintain a consistent schedule for at least two weeks at a time, even on weekends. This consistency helps align your body's internal clock, reducing the adverse health effects associated with irregular shift patterns. Additionally, understanding and tracking your temperature minimum becomes crucial. If your body temperature is on the rise, seek light exposure; if it's decreasing, avoid light. This Temperature-Light Rule simplifies how to manage your exposure to light based on your body’s circadian rhythm, rather than strictly by the time of day. For those working unusual hours, like finishing a shift in the early morning, your circadian dead zone will differ from the typical midday period. Staying attuned to your body's temperature signals can guide you in optimizing light exposure to better support your sleep and wakefulness cycles."
